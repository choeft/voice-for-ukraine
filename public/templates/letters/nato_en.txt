Dear Mr./Mrs.  ___,

My name is [FIRSTNAME] [LASTNAME] and I’m a [NATIONALITY] citizen.

I am writing to you because NATO is failing to secure peace on the European continent.

The argument that NATO won’t invoke Article 5 and send troops directly in to assist Ukraine because it is not a member state seems baseless when considering the Organization's former and pivotal role in ending the Bosnian War in 1995. The primary justification at that time was to prevent ethnic cleansing on European soil. Just as in 1995, the two counties blocking the UNs resolutions are China and Russia. As of 2nd of March 2022 Russian military killed over 2000 Ukrainian civilians, among them many children. It is apparent from reports that Russian troops are receiving orders to destroy civilian infrastructures, killing citizens hiding in residential areas, hospitals, kindergartens, and schools.

The Ukrainian army is about 1⁄5 of the size of the Russian army and it is currently heroically defending the country against invaders - the Russian military and Vladimir Putin’s allies such R. Kadyrov and A. Lukashenko. By choosing to remain inactive and not to engage directly in the Ukrainian Russian War, NATO is effectively sacrificing Ukraine as a country along with innocent lives. NATO, more than anyone else, will go down in the history books as responsible for not preventing this massacre.

As an [NATIONALITY] tax-paying citizen I refuse to accept inaction. I am calling on NATO to stop the carnage in Ukraine.

-               “No-fly zone” over Ukraine;
-               The immediate retreat of units that attack Ukrainian targets, especially civilian ones;
-               The immediate removal of all heavy weapons around Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Mariupol.

I expect a leading position in the defense of basic democratic values and human rights in Europe. History will show who stood up for the people of Ukraine, citizens of Europe, in those dark hours.  I hope you will find your conscience on the right page.

Yours Sincerely,
[FIRSTNAME] [LASTNAME]
