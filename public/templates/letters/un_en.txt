Dear Mr./Mrs.  ___,

My name is [FIRSTNAME] [LASTNAME] and I am a [NATIONALITY] citizen.

I am writing to you because the UN is failing to secure peace on the European continent.

The UN was founded after World War II to guarantee and monitor peace on the European continent and globally. From the beginning of the war, the Russian military killed over 2000 Ukrainian civilians, among them many children. It is now apparent that Russian troops have received orders to destroy civilian infrastructure and kill citizens hiding in residential areas, hospitals, kindergartens and schools. Moreover, Russian military forces are actively blocking the evacuation of civilians and delivery of humanitarian aid to the cities left with no basic supplies, by shooting civilian buses, private and NGO vehicles. The Ukrainian army is about 1⁄5 of the size of the Russian army and it is currently defending the country against invaders - the Russian military and Vladimir Putin’s allies such as R. Kadyrov and A. Lukashenko. A systematic wiping out of villages, towns and their civilian population is happening BEFORE OUR EYES. Did the UN and NATO decide to stand by anxiously leaving Ukraine alone?

 As a [NATIONALITY] tax-paying citizen, I do not accept your inaction. I’m calling the UN to end the violence in Ukraine by doing the following:

   - Setting up a No-Fly Zone over Ukraine;
   - The immediate retreat of units that attack Ukrainian targets, especially civilian ones;
   - The immediate removal of all heavy weapons around Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Mariupol;
   - Providing financial, organizational, and legal support to Ukraine in the process of acquiring  drones        and fighter jets for the country's self-defence;
 - Supply of protective equipment to the Ukrainian army and civil defence of cities

 Further steps are left to your expertise.

By doing nothing, you are actively sacrificing the country of Ukraine and innocent lives. I hope you find yourself and your conscience on the right page.
[FIRSTNAME] [LASTNAME]
