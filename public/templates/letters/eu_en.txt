Dear Mr./Mrs.  ___,

My name is [FIRSTNAME] [LASTNAME] and I am a [NATIONALITY] citizen.

The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union emphasizes the solidarity that binds Europe and the overseas countries to ensure the development of their prosperity, following the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.

Russia invaded Ukraine on the 24th of February 2022, which is now a decisive date in our collective history, for Ukraine, Europe and indeed the whole World.

Russian troops are committing war crimes on the territory of Ukraine, attacking infrastructure, hospitals, kindergartens, and are using missile strikes in civilian areas. As of March 2, Ukraine lost over 2000 civilian lives, among them many children.

The EU must develop a unified response of all its Member States. The delivery of weapons is delayed by the lack of cohesion and integrity. Ukrainian Authorities are sincerely grateful for the defensive weapons provided by the Union, but due to the lack of unity, the supply of arms implies delays, which leads to further losses of innocent lives.

V. Putin uses Ukrainian history as a member of the Soviet Union as a “rationale” for invasion. Let me kindly remind you that 10 countries and GDR out of 27 EU member-states were part of the Eastern bloc. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine presents a direct threat to these member states and the EU as an organization. Let me also remind you that Ukraine received guarantees from the international community on security and territorial integrity. We are legally and morally obliged to respect it.

One day, it must be documented and shown in history that all the countries of the European Union have not retreated from their values and will proudly tell the next generations about their unity and invincibility.

There is no alternative. I call for immediate action to stop the violence in Ukraine!

Yours Sincerely,
[FIRSTNAME] [LASTNAME]
